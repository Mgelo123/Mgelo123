# 💫 About Me:
I’m a cybersecurity student and aspiring penetration tester with a strong focus on offensive security, enumeration, and real-world attack methodology.
I’m currently working toward Hack The Box CPTS, building a solid foundation through structured learning, hands-on labs, and personal projects.

My goal is to collaborate on cybersecurity projects, continuously sharpen my technical depth, and grow into a senior security researcher over time — not by shortcuts, but through consistent practice and real understanding.

I value methodology over tools, clarity over noise, and learning things the right way.

##🔐 What I’m Working On

#🧠 Hack The Box Academy (Offensive Track)

Network Enumeration with Nmap

Footprinting

Information Gathering (Web)

Vulnerability Assessment

File Transfers

#🧪 CTF-style labs focused on:

Enumeration-first mindset

Linux privilege escalation fundamentals

Web attack surfaces

#🐍 Python for Cybersecurity

CLI tools

Automation scripts

Socket-based networking projects

I treat every lab and project as if it were a real assessment, documenting findings and improving my workflow.

##🛠️ Technical Interests & Skills

Offensive Security

Network & service enumeration

Web reconnaissance

Vulnerability analysis

Basic exploitation concepts

Post-exploitation fundamentals

Tools & Environments

Nmap, Burp Suite, Metasploit, Wireshark

Linux (Kali, Ubuntu), Windows

Hack The Box, TryHackMe, CTF platforms

Programming

Python (automation, file handling, networking basics)

Writing small tools to understand how things work, not just use them

##🤝 Collaboration

I’m actively looking to collaborate on:

Beginner–intermediate pentesting tools

Enumeration & recon automation

Learning-focused cybersecurity projects

CTF writeups and methodology breakdowns

If you care about learning deeply, documenting your process, and improving together — I’m in.

##🧠 How I Think

Strong background in math and analytical problem-solving

Interested in self-improvement, discipline, and long-term growth

I enjoy breaking complex topics into clear, teachable pieces

I believe consistency beats talent

##🏃 Outside Tech

When I’m not breaking things (ethically), I’m usually:

🧗 Rock climbing

🏀 Playing basketball or volleyball

🏓 Ping pong, 🎱 billiards, 🎳 bowling

Exploring fashion and fitness

Working on personal development

I’m competitive, curious, and enjoy pushing limits — mentally and physically.
